arxiv.org is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for nearly two million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

arxiv.org maintainers believe in open, free, and accessible information. In addition to free and easy access to the articles themselves, arxiv.org also provides ways to harvest its metadata. This metadata includes information such as the article's unique identification number, author(s), title, abstract (Aside: Every scientific article has an abstract â€” a brief summary of the main points of the article), the date the article was added to the arxiv and when it was last modified, licence under which the article was published, etc. This metadata is used by a variety of research tools that investigate scientific research trends, provide intelligent scientific search techniques, and in many other areas.

Each function includes a description and example calls in the docstring.
